        <p>
          I love to learn and to be challenged. I have always enjoyed building
          things whether it's a construcion project or building something
          online.

          Apart from being a web developer, I enjoy most of my time being
          outdoors. In the winter, I am an avid snowboarder. During the warmer
          months I enjoy fishing, hiking and camping.

          When indoors, I follow a number of YouTube channels that I enjoy
          watching. I also spend a large amount of my free time learning more
          about web development and general programming.
