            <p>
              Co-led startup of new Utah office. After the office and teams were
              established, I led a cross-functional team of fifteen
              representatives. The team goal was to onboard new customers by
              assisting them with personal loans. I was successful here by using
              my communication and analytic skills to review data, identify
              trends and drive results based on the data.
              <br></br>
              <br></br>
              Due to the nature of the cross-functional team, knowledge of
              several different processes and procedures were required. This was
              a challenge because the information for these processes and
              procedures were spread across different locations. After
              identifying this I spearheaded the creation of an internal Wiki
              page to house the content. This significantly improved the ramp-up
              time for leadership to onboard and train new employees on
              processes due to the content being available in one location.
