              Successfully onboarded team of fourteen new representatives during
              the initial wave of COVID-19, our team was in-office for one day
              before moving to a work from home environment. This was a success
              due to setting expectations early with the team and focusing on
              each representativesâ€™ personal goals during weekly meetings. 21%
              of the representatives from my initial new hire team have since
              been promoted into internal management roles. Identified need and
              spearheaded creation of internal Wiki/Confluence pages to optimize
              the onboarding and training process for NetCredit leadership. This
              dramatically improved the onboarding process for section managers
              and the leadership team due to all of the content being available
              in one location.
